Brute force algorithm comparison to Johnson's algorithm for solving two and three machine flowshop problem

Tasks are created in loop. Values of Mx (where x is machine number) are generated randomly,
they represent time needed for x machine to process task.
Computation time available for later comparison.

You may want to change:
1. Number of tasks by changing `TASK_COUNT`
2. Minimal time for machine by changing `MIN_TIME`
3. Maximal time for machine by changing `MAX_TIME`
4. You can save some time by turning off `SHOW_PERMUTATIONS`
5. To `GENERATE_PLOT` You will need `gnuplot`
6. I used `GENERATE_TEST_DATA` to generate tables below

### Test times

|9|0.006 ms|98|168.383 ms|93|
|10|0.006 ms|124|1814.9 ms|124|
|11|0.006 ms|134|19637.4 ms|131|

### Visualisation
I'm using `gnuplot` to visualise chosen task order.

Example visualisation for three machines:

### Summary
Johnson's algorithm is significantly faster than brute force and gives the same results as brute force.
Three machines version of Johnson's algorithm is not perfect but it is close enough for the time savings.
