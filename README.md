Brute force algorithm comparison to Johnson's algorithm for solving two and three machine flowshop problem

Tasks are created in loop. Values of Mx (where x is machine number) are generated randomly,
they represent time needed for x machine to process task.
Computation time available for later comparison.

You may want to change:
1. Number of tasks by changing `TASK_COUNT`
2. Minimal time for machine by changing `MIN_TIME`
3. Maximal time for machine by changing `MAX_TIME`
4. You can save some time by turning off `SHOW_PERMUTATIONS`
5. To `GENERATE_PLOT` You will need `gnuplot`
6. I used `GENERATE_TEST_DATA` to generate tables below

### Visualisation
I'm using `gnuplot` to visualise chosen task order.

### Summary
Johnson's algorithm is significantly faster than brute force and gives the same results as brute force.
Three machines version of Johnson's algorithm is not perfect but it is close enough for the time savings.
Three machines NEH algorithm gives almost ideal results (most of the time, they are the same as brute force) 
in a time comparable to Johnson's algorithm.
