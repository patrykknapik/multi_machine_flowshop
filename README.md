Brute force algorithm (for now, johnson's pending) for solving two and three machine flowshop problem

Tasks are created in loop. Values of Mx (where x is machine number) are generated randomly,
they represent time needed for x machine to process task.
Computation time available for later comparison.

You may want to change:
1. Number of tasks by changing `TASK_COUNT`
2. Minimal time for machine by changing `MIN_TIME`
3. Maximal time for machine by changing `MAX_TIME`
